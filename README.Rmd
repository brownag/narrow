The goal of carrow is to wrap the [Arrow Data C API](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/CDataInterface.html) and [Arrow Stream C API](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/CStreamInterface.html) to provide lightweight Arrow support for R packages to consume and produce streams of data in Arrow format. Right now it's just a fun way for me to learn about Arrow!

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("paleolimbot/carrow")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(carrow)
(vctr <- as_carrow_array(ggplot2::mpg))
```

```{r}
tibble::as_tibble(from_carrow_array(vctr))
```
